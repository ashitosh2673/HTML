    <!-- Form tag -->
    <!-- The <form> tag is used to create an HTML form for user input. -->
    <!-- The <form> element can contain one or more of the following form elements: -->
    <!-- The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted. -->
    <!-- The method attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or POST) to be used when submitting the form data. -->
    <!-- get: Appends the form-data into the URL in name/value pairs
    Use this method when the form has no side-effects (such as search forms). -->
    <!-- Use this method when we want to bookmark the page or when we want to send the page to someone else. -->
    <!-- Do not use this method for handling sensitive information like password etc. -->
    <!-- Get method is having a limit characters length. Which depends on the browser we use -->
    <!-- If we want to send large amount of data then we should use post method. -->
    <!-- post: Sends the form-data as an HTTP post transaction
    Use this method when the form has side-effects (such as modifying a database or cookie) or when the form contains sensitive information (such as passwords). 
    We can use this method to send large amount of data. 
    The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request and we can see it in the browser's developer tools under Network -> Payload tab
    We can use this method to handle sensitive information like password etc. -->

    <!-- Name : The name attribute specifies a name for the form. This will be unique for each form on a page. -->

    <!-- Target : The target attribute specifies if the submitted result will open in a new browser tab, a frame, or in the current window.
    The target attribute can have one of the following values:
    _blank - The response is displayed in a new window or tab
    _self - The response is displayed in the same frame (this is default)
    _parent - The response is displayed in the parent frame
    _top - The response is displayed in the full body of the window -->
    
    <!-- Enctype : The enctype attribute specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitting it to the server (only for method="post").
    
    1. enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded" : Default. All characters are encoded before sent to server.
    
    2. enctype="multipart/form-data" : No characters are encoded. This value is required when you are using forms that have a file upload control/tag
    
    3. enctype="text/plain" : Spaces are converted to "+" symbols, but no special characters are encoded. We can use this type for debugging purpose -->

    <!-- The autocomplete attribute specifies whether or not an input field should have autocomplete enabled. We can use On/Off value to enable/disable this feature. -->

    <!-- The novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies that the form-data (input) should not be validated when submitted. -->
    
    <!-- Example -->
    <form name="form2" action="index.html" method="get" target="_top" novalidate autocomplete="off">
        <input type="text" name="first_name" id="first_name" placeholder="First Name"><br><br>
        <br>
        <input type="text" name="last_name" id="last_name" placeholder="Last Name"><br><br>
        <br>
        <input type="email" name="email" id="email" placeholder="Email"><br><br>
        <br>
        <input type="file" name="file" id="file"><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" onclick="">
    </form>

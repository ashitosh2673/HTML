    <!-- Picture Tag -->

    <!-- 
      A picture element contains zero or more source elements and one img element to provide versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.
      The browser will consider each child <source> element and choose the best match among them; if no matches are found, the URL of the <img> element's src attribute is selected. The selected image is then presented in the space occupied by the <img> element.
      The <source> element's srcset attribute gives the browser a hint of the image's resolution, so that it can select the best source if the browser must resize the image.
      The media attrbute specifies the media query of the resource's intended media; this lets the browser select the source based on the media query.
